## Quote

**Dr. Norman Finkelstein** — Dedicated scholar, political scientist, author, and activist. Renowned for his critical analysis of the Israeli–Palestinian occupation and Holocaust politics.

> "The Holocaust has proven to be an indispensable ideological weapon. Through its deployment, one of the world's most formidable military powers, with a horrendous human rights record, has cast itself as a 'victim' state, and the most successful ethnic group in the US has likewise acquired victim status."
